
## Where do we come from?

In the automotive world, we have to deal with an **incredible variety of products**.  
Tens of different manufacturers, with different models, model variants and then adapted to different markets and regions, depending on legal requirements.

## Developing Projects or Products?

When we develop a product for a customer, we start by copying code and modifying it to meet the customer demands.  

This approach is also known as **"clone and own"** and leads to Software erosion.

Setting up each product as an individual project and rewriting the software again and again would be death for any company.

You have to find a suitable way to map this multitude of product variants via configurations.
We solve this via software product lines and thus break down the complexity of our product range to a certain extent.

## Compliance ≠ free

In the automotive world, however, we are very often dealing with **safety-relevant functions** where human life, or at least the safety of human life, is paramount.  

Every developer is provided with a set of **process rules** for this purpose. This can be used to develop standardized software in such environments.  

Even if many see this as an obstacle, it is intended more as an aid.

I am talking here about ISO26262 and Automotive Spice, or A.SPICE for short.
